Research Corporation for Scientific Advancement puts on a series of unique conferences designed to catalyze new scientific reasearch collaborations across disciplines. I led teams at Datascope and IDEO that that ran collaboration network surveys and used simulated annealing (a stochastic optimization technique) to help RCSA most effectively group up scientists during their conferences. The algorithm maximizes mixing, interest in topics, and other factors.

I spoke about this work at O'Reilly Strata 2017:
